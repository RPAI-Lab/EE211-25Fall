# Shell Commands & ROS2 Installation

> **Last Update:** 2025-9-13

<br>



## 1. Basic Shell Commands on Ubuntu

> Please follow the TA's demonstration in class

- `APT`: software package manager
- `Bash`: a widely used shell interface

A video recording will be uploaded soon
</p>


## 2. Install ROS2 Humble

> It is recommended to follow the official instruction to install ros2 from APT source: [check here](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html)

- You are supposed to install **ros2 humble**, since ubuntu 22.04 is bound to this version.
- If you are already familiar with the installation, you may find an APT ros2 mirror source more comfortble, e.g., [tsinghua ros2 mirror](https://mirror.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/ros2/)
